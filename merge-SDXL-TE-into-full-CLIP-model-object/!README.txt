Step 0: Point to the original CLIP .cache ViT-L-14.pt model file -> state_dict. Then, copy that to the folder where all these scripts AND the SDXL text encoder .safetensors is located.

Step 1: Insert the filename_of_TE.safetensors in the code.

Run all steps one after another. Finally: combined-ViT-L-14-full-model-object.pt

Delete all the other intermediate model files. 

You can use "combined-ViT-L-14-full-model-object.pt" in the same way you could use a normal fine-tuned CLIP model, e.g. with my scripts for gradient ascent, or using it in ComfyUI after converting to a state_dict again.

The model will be unaligned in multimodality, i.e. the text transformer won't be aligned to the vision transformer and their projection space, if the TE was previously fine-tuned in SDXL.

Freeze the Text encoder, and try fine-tuning with the visual.transformer requiring grad (see code for details).

This is highly experimental, and I wouldn't bet on the outcome being positive, i.e. that this works to "re-align" the vision transformer and projection space to whatever the TE has been fine-tuned to in SDXL with U-Net, e.g. using kohya.

However: Happy experimenting!


To load the model for fine-tuning:

clipmodel = 'ViT-L/14'
device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
_, preprocess = clip.load(clipmodel, device=device)
model = torch.load("path/to/.cache/clip/combined-ViT-L-14-full-model-object.pt")
model = model.cuda()

For example, with my GmP fine-tuning code, "normal" LR of ~1e-7:

{'params': transformer_parameters, 'lr': 1e-10},#Text Transformer params

There are just some initial suggestions with regard to orders of magnitude that *MAY* work (probably better than completely freezing, according to GPT-4o).
For a rough orientation only. It depends on how excessively you trained the TE with U-Net, and on what kind of dataset.
